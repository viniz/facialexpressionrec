## Introduction

Facial expression recognition is a very important research field to understand human emotions. There are six basic universal expressions that are recognized in several different cultures and are widely used in the literature: fear, sad, angry, disgust, surprise and happy. Often, the neutral expression is also taken in consideration, which sums up to the seven expressions widely used in the field.
Although it seems that the facial expression recognition problem has been solved, there is a large difference between the results achieved using the intra-database (i.e., training in one database and testing in a subject-independent set of the same database) and the cross-database protocols (i.e., training in one or more databases and evaluating in different databases).
